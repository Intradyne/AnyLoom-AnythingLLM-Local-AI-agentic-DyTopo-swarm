It works by applying a reciprocal rank function to each result's position across the lists, then summing the scores to produce a final, balanced ranking that preserves both semantic relevance and exact term matches. In this stack, RRF is used by the qdrant-rag MCP server on port 6334 to merge dense and sparse search results for hybrid search (per architecture reference).",
